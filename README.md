# Ovatu PHP Code Test

This project contains a simple Laravel 12 application with the following components:

1. An SQLite database set (all migration and seed setup), complete with example dataset.
2. Object models mapped to each table in the SQLite DB (including relations).
3. Basic controller showing the full contents of the included DB.

Also, don't worry, we're not beer-obsessed, we just wanted to make sure that we chose a small task from something completely out of our core product focus.

## What we would like to see from you.

We would like you to showcase your software design experience by exposing this very simple dataset to a REST API.

1. We would like to see an endpoint to expose the beers table.
2. The endpoint should include an option to search as well as pagination.
3. We would like to see at least one write operation, what it does is up to you.
4. Some form of testing would be nice to see.

## If you'd like to really flex your skills, here are some ideas

1. Implement an Authentication system
2. Make changes to scale the data 1000x and support up to 10,000 requests/second
3. User review / rating system
4. Recommendation / 'if you liked' system.
